# PCEP Job Board Bot

Just a discord bot for the PCEP server that notifies if a new job is found for the following companies:  
[The Standard](https://standard.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/Search)  
[Apex Fintech Solutions](https://peak6group.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/apexfintechsolutions)  
[Trimble](https://trimble.wd1.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/TrimbleCareers/jobs)  

The bot uses the company's Workday API to fetch job listings, with a scheduled cron job running hourly on weekdays from 6 AM to 12 PM to look for any newly posted jobs.

Adding more soon! If you want to suggest a company, feel free to create a request on the [Issues](https://github.com/ricer0ll/pcep-job-board/issues) section.  

## Contributing
Contributions are also welcomed. The bot is written in Go using the [DisGo](https://github.com/disgoorg/disgo) library. 

## Running Locally
You may also run this bot locally on your machine using your own Discord Bot Token and can specify which channel to send notifications to. Create a copy of the `.env.example` and replace the values. To run locally, you can try running it directly, but I recommend installing Docker and Docker Compose in your system to ensure it runs on every system.

Then, change your current working directory to the root of `discord-bot` directory:  
```
$ pwd
/home/user/some-place/pcep-job-board/discord-bot
```  

Install go packages:  
`$ go mod tidy`  

Start the docker container with:  
`$ docker compose up -d --build`  

To stop the container, run:  
`$ docker compose down -v`
